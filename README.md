# bling.vim

A highly tuned Vim distribution that will blow your socks off!

## introduction

this is my personal vim distribution that i have tweaked over time and evolved from a simple vanilla vimrc configuration to a full-blown distribution that it is today.

while it is quite easy to install this distribution (i designed it that way for me to easily switch between computers), i actually recommend that you don't use it verbatim.  configuring a vimrc from scratch was an incredibly awesome experience and i want you to experience it too.  take a look at my vimrc for ideas, as well as the credits section.

## installation

1.  clone this repository into your `~/.vim` directory
1.  `git submodule init && git submodule update`
1.  `ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc`
1.  install the fonts found in the `font` directory, and head over to the [powerline documentation](https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html)
1.  on osx/linux, run `vim` and it will automatically ask you to install plugins.  if you're running a gui vim this check is disabled, so you need to run `:NeoBundleInstall` manually.
1.  done!

## modifications

*  if you have either [ack](http://betterthangrep.com/) or [ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) installed, they will be used for `grepprg`
*  backup/swap/undo are all turned on and persistant.  they are stored in `~/.vim/.cache` which stays out of your way.

## mappings

### insert mode
*  `<C-h>` move the cursor left (default behavior maps to `<BS>`)
*  `<C-l>` move the cursor right (default behavior maps to leave insert mode)

### normal mode

*  `<Space>` toggles hisearch
*  `<Down>` `<Up>` maps to `:bprev` and `:bnext` respectively

*  `gp` remapped to visually reselect the last paste
*  profiling shortcuts
   * `<leader>DD` starts profiling all functions and files into a file `profile.log`
