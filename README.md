# bling.vim

A highly tuned vim distribution that will blow your socks off!

## introduction

this is my ***personal*** vim distribution that i have tweaked over time and evolved from a simple vanilla vimrc configuration to a full-blown distribution that it is today.

while it is very easy to install this and get up and running on a brand new machine (a use case i have), i recommend that you do not install this unless you fully understand everything that's going on inside.  scan it for tips and tricks, or fork and customize it for *your* needs.

## installation

1.  clone this repository into your `~/.vim` directory
1.  `git submodule init && git submodule update`
1.  `mv ~/.vimrc ~/.vimrc.backup`
1.  create the following shim and save it as `~/.vimrc`:

```
let g:dotvim_settings = {}
let g:dotvim_settings.version = 1
source ~/.vim/vimrc
```

1.  startup vim and neobundle will detect and ask you install any missing plugins.  you can also manually initiate this with `:NeoBundleInstall`
1.  done!

### versioning

the `g:dotvim_settings.version` is a simple version number which is manually edited.  it is used to detect whether significant breaking changes have been introduced so that users of the distribution can be notified accordingly.

## customization

*  since the distribution is just one file, customization is straightforward.  any customizations can be added to the `g:dotvim_settings` variable, which will be used whilst sourcing the distribution's `vimrc` file.  here is an example:

```
" this is the bare minimum
let g:dotvim_settings = {}
let g:dotvim_settings.version = 1

" here are some basic customizations, please refer to the top of the vimrc file for all possible options
let g:dotvim_settings.default_indent = 3
let g:dotvim_settings.max_column = 80
let g:dotvim_settings.colorscheme = 'my_awesome_colorscheme'

" by default, language specific plugins are not loaded.  this can be changed with the following:
let g:dotvim_settings.plugin_groups_exclude = ['ruby','python']

" if there are groups you want always loaded, you can use this:
let g:dotvim_settings.plugin_groups_include = ['go']

" alternatively, you can set this variable to load exactly what you want
let g:dotvim_settings.plugin_groups = ['core','web']

" if there is a particular plugin you don't like, you can define this variable to disable them entirely
let g:dotvim_settings.disabled_plugins=['vim-foo','vim-bar']

" finally, load the distribution
source ~/.vim/vimrc

" anything defined here are simply overrides
set wildignore+=\*/node_modules/\*
set guifont=Wingdings:h10
```

## autocomplete

this distribution will pick one of three combinations, in the following priority:

1.  [neocomplete][nc] + [neosnippet][ns] if you have `lua` enabled.
2.  [youcompleteme][ycm] + [ultisnips][us] if you have compiled YCM.
3.  [neocomplcache][ncl] + [neosnippet][ns] if you only have vimscript available

this can be overridden with `g:dotvim_settings.autocomplete_method`

## standard modifications

*  if you have either [ack](http://betterthangrep.com/) or [ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) installed, they will be used for `grepprg`
*  all temporary files are stored in `~/.vim/.cache`, such as backup files and persistent undo

## mappings

### insert mode
*  `<C-h>` move the cursor left

*  `<leader>s` sort selection
*  `>` and `<` automatically reselects the visual selection

## plugins

### [unite.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim)
*  this is an extremely powerful plugin that lets you build up lists from arbitrary sources
*  mappings
  *  `<space><space>` go to anything (files, buffers, MRU, bookmarks)
  *  `<space>y` select from previous yanks
  *  `<space>l` select line from current buffer
  *  `<space>b` select from current buffers
  *  `<space>o` select from outline of current file
  *  `<space>s` quick switch buffer
  *  `<space>/` recursively search all files for matching text (uses `ag` or `ack` if found)

### [bufkill.vim](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1147)
*  `<leader>bd` or `:BD` will kill a buffer without changing the window layout

### [sneak.vim](https://github.com/justinmk/vim-sneak)
*  motion on steriods

### [easygrep](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2438)
*  makes search/replacing in your project a lot easier without relying on `find` and `sed`
*  the loading time of this plugin is relatively heavy, so it is not loaded at startup.  to load it on-demand, use `<leader>vo`, which opens the options window.
*  `<leader>vv` find word under the cursor
*  `<leader>vV` find whole word under the cursor
*  `<leader>vr` perform global search replace of word under cursor, with confirmation
*  `<leader>vR` same as vr, but matches whole word

*  `<leader>gl` log
*  `<leader>gp` push
*  `<leader>gw` stage
*  `<leader>gr` rm
*  in addition to all the standard bindings when in the git status window, you can also use `U` to perform a `git checkout --` on the current file

*  nice log history viewer for git
*  `<leader>gv`

### [undotree](https://github.com/mbbill/undotree)
*  visualize the undo tree
*  `<F5>` to toggle

### [youcompleteme][ycm]/[ultisnips][us]

### [neocomplcache][ncl]/[neosnippet][ns]
*  autocomplete/snippet support as a fallback choice when YCM and/or python is unavailable
*  `<Tab>` to select the next match, or expand if the keyword is a snippet
